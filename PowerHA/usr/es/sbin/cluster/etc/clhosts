#  -------------------------------------------
#  Upon proper configuration, this file (clhosts) should contain a list
#  of IP labels/addresses of any HACMP for AIX servers with which the
#  Cluster Information daemon (clinfo) may communicate.  Note that this 
#  includes servers from any clusters accessible through logical network 
#  connections. The installed version of clhosts on an HACMP for AIX 
#  client node will differ from that on an HACMP for AIX server node.
#
#  Contents of clhosts on an HACMP for AIX client node
#  ---------------------------------------------------
#
#  As installed, the clhosts file on an HACMP for AIX client node will 
#  contain NO IP labels/addresses.  This is because HACMP for AIX server 
#  addresses will vary from cluster to cluster, and these addresses must 
#  be provided by the user at installation time.
# 
#  This file should contain all boot-time IP labels/addresses and/or the
#  service IP labels/addresses of HACMP for AIX servers to be contacted 
#  through logical network connections.  Upon startup, Clinfo uses these 
#  IP labels/addresses to attempt communication with a Clsmuxpd process 
#  executing on an HACMP for AIX server.  If Clinfo succeeds in 
#  communicating with a Clsmuxpd process executing on a server at one of 
#  the provided addresses, it then acquires an entire cluster map, 
#  including a list of all HACMP for AIX server interface IP addresses.
#  From then on, it will use this list, rather than the user-defined
#  list in the clhosts file, to recover from Clsmuxpd communication loss.
#  However, if Clinfo does not succeed in communicating with a Clsmuxpd
#  process at any of the provided addresses, it will continue indefinitely
#  to attempt communication, periodically trying each IP label/address
#  in the clhosts file, in sequential order.
#
#  An example list of IP labels/addresses follows (Note: IP labels/addresses 
#  begin in column 1. Comments preceded by '#' are permitted):
#
#  cowrie_en0_cl83    #  cowrie service
#  140.186.91.189     #  limpet service
#  floyd_en0_cl83     #  floyd service
#  squid_en0_cl83     #  squid service
#
#  Contents of clhosts on an HACMP for AIX server node
#  ---------------------------------------------------
#
#  As installed, the clhosts file on an HACMP for AIX server node will contain
#  a loopback IP address.  Clinfo will attempt to communicate with a Clsmuxpd
#  process locally.  If it succeeds, it then acquires an entire cluster
#  map, including a list of all HACMP for AIX server interface IP addresses.  
#  From then on, it will use this list rather than the provided loopback 
#  IP address in the clhosts file to recover from Clsmuxpd communication loss.
#  However, if Clinfo does not succeed in communicating with a Clsmuxpd
#  process locally, it will continue indefinitely to attempt communication
#  periodically ONLY to the local IP address.  For this reason, it is
#  adviseable for the user to replace the loopback address with all HACMP for 
#  AIX boot-time and/or service IP labels/addresses accessible through logical 
#  connections with this node, just as on an HACMP for AIX client node.  The 
#  loopback address is provided only as a convenience.
